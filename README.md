# Terverak

There are two types of card:
 - Minion Card
 - Spell Card

Each card can be activated in two different ways:
 - You can spend some mana to play the card
 - You can discard for free the card (for example, to get 3 mana for the turn)

Each new turn, we draw 2 more cards.
All the cards played and destroyed are found in the deck again when the deck is empty.

## Warning
For the moment, the game is not finished. When you enter the game, you need to press the A key to see the cards.
Then, you can play the game by :
 - Dragging the cards to the board to play them (it will cost mana indicated on the card left upper corner)
 - Dragging the cards to the discard zone to discard them (it is free)
 - Press the Enter key to end your turn
