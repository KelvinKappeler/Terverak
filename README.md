# Terverak

There are two types of card:
 - Minion Card
 - Spell Card

Each card can be activated in two different ways:
 - You can spend some mana to play the card
 - You can discard for free the card (for example, to get 3 mana for the turn)

Each new turn, we draw 2 more cards.
All the cards played and destroyed are found in the deck again.
